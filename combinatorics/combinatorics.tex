\maketitle

\fontsize{16}{20}\selectfont

\begin{enumerate}
\item For breakfast you can have either oatmeal or cereal.  On top,
  you can have either blueberries, strawberries, or blackberries (you
  have to choose exactly one kind of fruit).  What are all the
  different breakfasts you could choose?  How many diffferent
  breakfasts are there?

  \newpage
\item What if you could also choose to have no fruit?  How many
  different breakfasts would there be now? \vspace{2in}

\item Now suppose you can still choose either oatmeal or cereal, but
  there are now seven different fruit choices (banana, pomegranate,
  strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, or tomato).  You get
  to choose exactly one fruit, or you can have no fruit.  How many
  different breakfasts can you choose? \vspace{2in}

\newpage
\item What if you could choose cereal, oatmeal, or cream of wheat, and
  you have the same fruit choices as before?  How many different
  breakfast combinations are there now? \vspace{1in}

\newpage
\item For lunch you are going to eat a sandwich and some fruit, but
  let's forget about the sandwich for now.  Suppose there are two
  types of fruit: grapes and apples.  If you have to choose one fruit
  then of course there are two different lunches you could have.  But
  being limited to only one kind of fruit is boring!  For lunch, you
  can choose any combination of fruits you want: you could have no
  fruit, or you could choose one fruit, or you could have both.  How
  many different lunch choices do you have?

\newpage
\item Now suppose there are three kinds of fruit: grapes, apples, and
  oranges.  Again, you can choose any fruits you want.  How many
  different lunch choices do you have? What are they? \vspace{2in}

\item What if there are four kinds of fruit (grapes, apples, oranges,
  and dragonfruit)?  How many lunch choices do you have now?


\newpage
\item Remember your sandwich?  To make a sandwich you need bread,
  cheese, meat, and toppings.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There are three different kinds of bread, and you have to
    choose one kind.
  \item There are four different kinds of cheese. You can choose one,
    or you can decide not to have any cheese.
  \item There are four different kinds of meat.  You have to choose
    one.
  \item There are three different toppings (lettuce, tomato, and
    pickles), and you can choose any combination of toppings you want.
  \end{itemize}

  How many different sandwiches can you make?
\end{enumerate}
